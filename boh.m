% Step 1: Specify single-phase transformer
% Define transformer parameters
core_type = 'core form'; % or 'shell form'
core_material = 'silicon steel'; % or specify the material
primary_voltage = 10000; % primary voltage in volts
secondary_voltage = 400; % secondary voltage in volts
frequency = 50; % frequency in Hz

% Step 2: Ideal transformer parameters
% Calculate transformer and turns ratio
transformer_ratio = primary_voltage / secondary_voltage;

% Assume wire insulation thickness (Kinsulation) of 2mm
Kinsulation = 3; % V
d_insulation = 0.5 * 1e-3;  % m

% Step 3: Design variables and calculations
% Assume a flux density (Bcore) of 1.3 Tesla
Bcore = 1.3; % Tesla

% Calculate cross-sectional area of the core based on flux density
Ac = primary_voltage * sqrt(2) / (4.44 * frequency * Bcore);
% Determine number of turns for primary and secondary windings
Np = round(primary_voltage / Kinsulation);
Ns = round(Np / transformer_ratio);

% Calculate peak flux density in the core
phi = Bcore * Ac;

% Step 4: Rated load current calculation
% Assume rated apparent power of 1100 kVA
S = 1100e3; % VA
% Calculate rated load current connected at secondary side
Is = S / (sqrt(3) * secondary_voltage);
% Calculate phase RMS value of current delivered at primary side
Ip = Is / transformer_ratio;

% Step 5: Core and winding dimensions
% Determine size of winding windows to meet current density requirement
% For example, assuming a maximum current density of 2 A/mm^2
current_density = 2e6; % A/m^2
window_area_primary = Ip / current_density;
window_area_secondary = Is / current_density;
% Determine detailed core and winding dimensions based on the calculated parameters

% Step 6: Electromagnetic analysis
% Calculate winding resistance based on winding geometry and turns
% Resistivity of copper wire (typical value)
rho_copper = 1.68e-8; % ohm*m
wire_length_primary = 2 * pi * Np * (Ac / pi); % assuming circular winding
wire_length_secondary = 2 * pi * Ns * (Ac / pi);
R_primary = rho_copper * wire_length_primary / (pi * (Kinsulation / 2)^2);
R_secondary = rho_copper * wire_length_secondary / (pi * (Kinsulation / 2)^2);


% Calculate magnetization inductance based on core material

% Calculate magnetizing branch associated with magnetizing current and core losses

% Calculate leakage impedance in equivalent circuit of transformer
